         <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

            <li>10 cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>Half a head of lettuce</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps:</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Cook the Bacon: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). 
            Cook the bacon on a baking sheet for 15 to 20 minutes, or until crispy.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Tomatoes: While the bacon is cooking, cut the tomatoes into halves.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Lettuce: Chop the lettuce into small, bite-sized squares.</li>
            <li>Soak the Bamboo Sticks: Soak the bamboo skewers in warm water while prepping the vegetables to prevent them from splintering while eating.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Kebabs: Once the bacon is done, begin assembling the kebabs.</li>
            <li>Layer the Ingredients: Take one bamboo skewer at a time and thread the ingredients in this order: lettuce, bacon, tomato.</li>
            <li>Repeat: Continue assembling the kebabs until each skewer is full, but avoid overloading them.</li>
         </ol>
